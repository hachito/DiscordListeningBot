# Discord Listening Bot

This is my first coding project that I made a couple years back when I started learning Python. I wanted to make something that my friends and I could get a kick out of, which at the time was a bot to catch any of us swearing and respond.
The main purpose of the bot is the !listen command. 
### !listen

This command makes the bot join an active voice channel and for every 6 seconds, makes an audiofile of the call and sees if any of the words said are in the bad word list,
and makes a loud noise if there is a word from the list is found in the audiofile. The biggest hurdle was getting the bot to stop recording without stopping the bot itself, as even now I can't seem to figure out how to do it, with the only advice I've been given and researched was to
quit using python and to use a different language. If I come back to this bot, it'll either be in a different language or I finished all of my other projects in the backlog.
